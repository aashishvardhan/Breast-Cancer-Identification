# Breast Cancer Analysis

This is the data analysis and prediction whether a person has Breast Cancer or not using different health attributes like Clump Thickness, Uniformity of Cell Size, Marginal Adhesion, Bare Nuclei, Mitoses, Single Epithelial Cell Size, Uniformity of Cell Shape, Bland Chromatin and Normal Nucleoli.

The analysis and predictions are made by referencing the data from Wisconsin Hospital. Different models have been tested out throughout the project and the Accuracies are as follows:

Accuracy of logisticRegression Model:  98.2456
Accuracy of linearRegression Model:  86.8182
Accuracy of DecisionTreeClassifier Model:  97.6608
Accuracy of RandomForestClassifier Model:  98.2456

The Logistic Regression has performed well on the test dataset. For more insights and confusion matrix of the model, refer the iPythonNotebook attached above.
